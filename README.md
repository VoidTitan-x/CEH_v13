# CEH v13 Theory Mastery — 90-Day Executive Summary
## Your Blueprint for Top 1% Exam Performance

---

## **THE SYSTEM YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING**

You're not just studying—you're building a **neuro-optimized learning machine** based on:

1. **Spaced Repetition** (Anki): Combat the forgetting curve[1]
2. **Interleaving** (Mixed practice): Build discrimination skills[2]
3. **Active Recall** (Retrieval practice): Test effect[3]
4. **Feynman Technique** (Elaborative encoding): Catch understanding gaps[4]
5. **Scenario Building** (Transfer learning): Apply theory to real exams[5]

## **YOUR DAILY 70-MINUTE STUDY FRAMEWORK**

```
MINUTE 0–10:    RETRIEVAL BURST
                Review 15–30 Anki cards (random order, weak areas first)
                Target: 80%+ accuracy
                WHY: Reset forgetting curve before new learning

MINUTE 10–35:   ENCODING PHASE
                Read 1 topic from official guide
                Teach aloud (Feynman) for 5 min
                Draw 1 diagram
                Write 2–3 elaboration notes
                WHY: Deep understanding, not passive reading

MINUTE 35–50:   ACTIVE RECALL
                Answer 10–15 practice questions (from memory, no notes)
                Minimum: 70% accuracy
                If lower: reread topic immediately
                WHY: Test effect = strongest memory mechanism

MINUTE 50–70:   SPACED INTERLEAVING
                Create 3–5 new Anki cards (specific format provided)
                Review 30–40 mixed cards (randomized, ALL modules)
                Target: 80%+ accuracy
                WHY: Discrimination + retention optimization
```

## **ANKI DECK STRATEGY**

**Target Card Count:** 750+ by Day 90

**Weekly Progression:**
- Week 1: 50 cards
- Week 2: 100 cards (cumulative)
- Week 3: 150 cards
- Week 4: 220 cards
- Weeks 5–10: Scale to 600+ cards
- Weeks 11–12: Maintain 750+, focus on maturation (review, not creation)

**Card Format (Non-negotiable):**
```
Front: [Topic Name] — [Specific Question]

Back:  [Concise answer, 1–2 sentences]
       
       WHY THIS MATTERS: [Exam relevance]
       
       RELATED CONCEPT: [Link to another card]
       
       EXAMPLE: [Real-world scenario]
```

**Maturation Target by Week:**

| Week | Matured Cards | Mock Score Target |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| 1–2  | 30–50        | N/A              |
| 3–4  | 100–150      | 50%              |
| 5–6  | 200–250      | 55–60%           |
| 7–8  | 300–350      | 65–70%           |
| 9–10 | 400–500      | 70–75%           |
| 11   | 600–650      | 75–80%           |
| 12   | 700–750      | 85–90%           |

---

## **WEEKLY MOCK EXAM SCHEDULE (Weeks 5–12)**

**Purpose:** Identify weak domains in real time; build exam stamina

**Format:** 125 questions, 4 hours, timed, no breaks

**Schedule:**
- **Week 5 (Day 35):** Mock Exam #1 (Modules 1–15) — Target: 60%
- **Week 6 (Day 42):** Mock Exam #2 (Modules 1–15) — Target: 65%
- **Week 7 (Day 49):** Mock Exam #3 (Modules 1–20 comprehensive) — Target: 70%
- **Week 8 (Day 56):** Mock Exam #4 (Modules 1–20) — Target: 72%
- **Week 9 (Day 63):** Mock Exam #5 (Modules 1–20) — Target: 75%
- **Week 10 (Day 70):** Mock Exam #6 (Modules 1–20) — Target: 78%
- **Week 11 (Day 77):** Mock Exam #7 (Full assessment) — Target: 82%
- **Week 12 (Day 84):** Mock Exam #8 (FINAL) — Target: 85%+

**Post-Exam Protocol (Mandatory):**
1. Review ALL wrong answers (minimum 45 min)
2. Create 5–10 new Anki cards from mistakes
3. Identify weakest module (lowest score)
4. Schedule 2-hour weak area deep-dive for next day

---

## **WEAK AREA PROTOCOL (When Score <70% on Topic)**

**Trigger:** Any practice test score <70% on module or <20 correct on full mock

**2-Hour Deep-Dive Session:**

1. **Reread (30 min):** Official guide chapter, make detailed notes
2. **Teach (20 min):** Explain concept 3 times aloud (get faster each time)
3. **Scenario Build (20 min):** Create 2 real-world attack scenarios
4. **Anki Rebuild (20 min):** Delete weak cards, create 10 detailed new cards
5. **Practice (20 min):** 20 questions on topic (target: 90%+)
6. **Schedule Followup (10 min):** Calendar reminder to review in 3 days

---

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **DO THIS:**
✅ Study 1–1.5 hours daily (consistency > cramming)  
✅ Randomize Anki cards (don't block by module)  
✅ Review before forgetting curve drops (every 3–5 days)  
✅ Teach concepts aloud (weekly Feynman session)  
✅ Take mock exams (weekly after Week 5)  
✅ Document every wrong answer (error log)  
✅ Deep-dive weak areas (2-hour sprints)  
✅ Sleep 7–8 hours (critical for memory consolidation)  

### **DON'T DO THIS:**
❌ Miss study days (breaks momentum + forgetting curve resets)  
❌ Cram new content 24 hours before exam  
❌ Study by module order (reduces transfer learning)  
❌ Passively read without Feynman teaching  
❌ Ignore weak areas (they'll haunt you on exam)  
❌ Create low-quality Anki cards (trash in = trash out)  
❌ Skip mock exams (no real-time feedback = overconfidence)  
❌ Study at irregular times (brain needs consistency)  

---

## **EMERGENCY CATCH-UP (If You Fall Behind)**

**Scenario:** You miss 3–5 days of study

**Recovery Plan (Next 10 days):**
1. **Double-up sessions:** 2–2.5 hours daily (still feasible for 10 days)
2. **Focus on active topics:** Complete current module, then prioritize:
   - OWASP Top 10 (Web attacks) — 20% of exam
   - MITRE ATT&CK — 15% of exam
   - Cryptography basics — 10% of exam
3. **Skip deep dives temporarily:** Postpone weak area 2-hour sessions
4. **Increase mock frequency:** Weekly → every 3–4 days
5. **Anki review only:** Don't create new cards; review aggressively
